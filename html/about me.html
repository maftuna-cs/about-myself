    <p>Iâ€™m originally from beautiful Fergana Walley in Central Asia, Uzbekistan. My family moved to capital city Tashkent when I was young, so I went to school and university there. I studied history and low at school, Television & Telecommunication at university. After graduating university, I moved to Seoul South Korea and started my career as an graphic designer and improved my skills in international marketing as well. During the times in Korea,  I started to interest in creating and designing websites. Thus I decided to study in Web Design & Development in Humber College, Canada</p>
